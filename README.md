# sharp gallery
The project consist of a full featured - but still (fucking) simple - standalone photo gallery software.

## but why ? facts.
I've made intensive research and testing on the current open-source offer. Every photo gallery software around there have serious drawbacks, at least to me. Without naming those projects, here are where they fail:
- SQL backend !? Again ? :rage:
- :disappointed: Ugly and old looking
- Not responsive :rage:
- Not maintained :unamused:
- Gallery management and settings are too complex :tired_face:
- Buggy "upload" feature :expressionless:

## Philosophy
For "the best" to happen I have thought of some basic guidelines and wishes:
- Open source
- No database
- It should be simple and intuitive to install and operate
- It has to look simple and beautiful at the same time. (=minimalist)
- We wont reinvent the wheel : it means we'll try to reuse existing components if it exists and fit the need

## Must have features
- Responsiveness
- Albums and sub-albums (or collections)
- Albums password protection
- Takes a photo directory tree as source.
- EXIF metadata support, and by that I mean *full* support
