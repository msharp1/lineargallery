# sharp gallery project
The goal is to write a full featured - but still (fucking) simple - standalone photo gallery software.
For this to happen I have thought of some basic guidelines and wishes:

- Open source
- No database
- It should be simple and intuitive to install and operate
- It has to look simple and beautiful at the same time. (=minimalist)
