# sharp gallery
The project consist of a full featured - but still (fucking) simple - standalone photo gallery software.

## but why ? facts.
I've made intensive research on the current open-source offer. Every photo gallery software around there have serious drawbacks, at least to me. Without naming thoses projects, here are where they fail:
- SQL backend


For this to happen I have thought of some basic guidelines and wishes:


## Philosophy
- Open source
- No database
- It should be simple and intuitive to install and operate
- It has to look simple and beautiful at the same time. (=minimalist)

## Must have features
- Responsiveness
- Albums and sub-albums (or collections)
- Albums password protection
- Takes a photo directory tree as source.
- EXIF metadata
